Our security test on test systems found serious weaknesses like hackable login pages and open doors attackers could use. We scanned with tools like Nmap, hacked in safely (e.g., stole fake database info), then fixed by updating software and blocking ports. Risks dropped from "urgent" to "low." Quick fixes: Update all apps weekly, use strong logins, scan regularly with free tools like OpenVAS. This prevents real breaches—email if questions
